# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?  **Conditionals come up very frequently in code when you need to make decisions when a program needs to evaluate an entery, compare information, or create a programming fork when alternate paths are needed**

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? **There may be coding efficiencies within Ruby that I may not know.  I hope that will be part of my training here or in Mod1**

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? **Problem solving is fun.  Taking the requirements and developing the appropriate code has always been enjoyable for me**
